                <h2>Hello, I'm Benjamin Pham - A Computer Science Major at Georgia State University from Georgia</h3>
                <p>I am currently a junior in Compute Science at GSU located in Atlanta, GA. I graduated with a B.S. in Biology in 2018 but have a strong interest in tech and am returning to GSU to learn and understand the working of Computer Science. I am working on learning how to code in many languages including JAVA, C, C++, and Javascript. I hope to find an internship in software engineering and find a position in tech as a Software Engineer after I graduate.</p>
